      <p>Hello my name one of the owners of transgenration 3.0. It has come to my attention that admins of the original account my see this as and attack on the account, It is not that this account and furure webpage was made to support the LGBTQA+ Community as that was my goal with the orginal account. What happned to the old account was my mistake I felt depressed after the admins told me how they felt about me. I screenshoted it and sent in anotehr group chat I was in and someone in that group chat told one of the admins to stop. It was my fault for not caring about the personal inforamtion in thoose text I should have not sent it at all but that was then this so now I hope we can come to terms with what happened and move on so I can conunite to serve to LGBTQA+ Community.</p>
